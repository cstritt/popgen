Tools for population genetics
==============================


## pairwise_nucdiff4D.py
Calculate pairwise genetic differences (dXY) from a vcf file which contains variant and non-variant fourfold degenerate sites.

## n-fold_degenerate.py
Given a reference genome sequence and a gene annotation in gff format, output positions with a codon degeneracy of n (4 by default).
